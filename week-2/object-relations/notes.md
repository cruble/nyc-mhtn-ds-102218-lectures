When to use private variables

bob's bank account
[ @balance=1000   ] <-add_item

sally's bank account
[ @balance=1200   ] <-add_item


bank_account._balance

def add_item():

flight
[@number=345, @pilots =['bob', 'melissa']]


When do we need the init method, and when getters and setters
review - calling property objects, syntax

creating the environment file, and then import environment into seed....But Why?
all function, class method, append each object to a list
